    <p>A long time ago I was looking for a domain name and finally settled on securso.com. Mainly because I'm a Scouser 
        (a person born in Liverpool, England) and securso is an anagram of Scouser.</p>
        
    <p>Several years ago, I decided securso.com was too expensive, so I acquired securso.uk and dropped the .com version.</p>
        
    <p>A few years ago, I was looking for a new domain name and found that <a href="https://retirednotout.uk">retirednotout.uk</a> 
        was available. I was very, very surprised that it was, so I grabbed it. After all I’m a retired programmer who refuses to 
        give up programming.</p>
        
    <p>I no longer have a website associated with this domain name.</p>
     
    <p>My website and blog now uses retirednoutout.uk, which is <a href="https://retirednotout.uk">here</a>.</p>
