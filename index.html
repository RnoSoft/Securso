    <p>A long time ago I was looking for a domain name and finally settled on securso.com. Mainly because securso is an anagram of
        Scouser. A Scouser is someone who was born and bred in Liverpool, England, which was where I was born.</p>
        
        <p>Several years ago, I decided scouser.com was too expensive, and that souser.uk would suffice. So, I acquired .uk and dropped 
        .com.</p>
        
        <p>A few years ago, I was looking for a new domain name, and found that <a href="https://retirednotout.uk">retirednotout.uk</a> was available. 
        I was very, very surprised  that it was, so I grabbed it. After all I’m a retired programmer who refuses to give up programming.</p>
        
        <p>I no longer have a website associated with the domain name.</p>
        
        <p>My website and blog now uses retirednoutout.uk, which is <a href="https://retirednotout.uk">here</a>.</p>
